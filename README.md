## Spring Boot Virtual Threads Explained: Easy Configuration & Examples

A simple app demonstrating how we can use virtual threads in Spring Boot application for enhanced concurrency and
performance

## App Overview

This is a simple app containing three endpoints: **/hello** for basic greetings, **/hello-with-delay** to simulate
response delays, and **/hello-async** for asynchronous processing.

## JMeter Test Plan

To test the performance of Spring Boot application with and without virtual threads:
<br/>**1.** Enable or disable virtual threads in the application properties.
<br/>**2** Run the JMeter test plan and analyze the output in the response time graph to compare the performance under
different configurations.

The JMeter Test Plan is available under the resources folder.
<br/>[src > main > resources > jmeter > Spring-Boot-Virtual-Threads.jmx]

## Postman Collection

Additionally, the Postman collection is available under the resources folder containing all the requests.
<br/>[src > main > resources > postman > Spring-Boot-Virtual-Threads.postman_collection.json]
